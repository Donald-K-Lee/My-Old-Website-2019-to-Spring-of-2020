# My old website
## Purpose
The purpose of this site was to link my social media platforms into one place and to show employers or the public what type of opportunities I am looking for and who I am.

## Progress
This site was coded with HTML, a lot of CSS, and Javascript. Since I self-taught myself coding and am a beginner, I didn't understand much about responsive web designs and also did not have a web design in mind. Therefore, I improvised the entire site and also believed that I needed a separate media query for each device until I realized that creating a separate media query for each device was extremely time-consuming! After halfway through the development of my site, I stumbled upon a Discord chat filled with coders and programmers who gave me a few coding tips that have helped me save a lot of time when building this website. 

## Conclusion
I learned a lot while creating this site, but because this site is meant for showing employers, application viewers, and is my first personal portfolio site, I wanted it to be visually appealing, however, it was not well coded. As a result, I created a new one that contains projects and more about me.
